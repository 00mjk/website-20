            This idea started when a random dude on twitter said he doesn't think "React Girls" is a
            good idea because he's gay and wouldn't want to be in a conference with only gay people.
            So now welcome to QueerJS.
            <br />
            This is a meetup where anyone is welcome to attend and support the speakers and the idea
            but all the speakers will be Queer.
            <br />
            Join us! There will be food ðŸŒˆ
