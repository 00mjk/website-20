# QueerJS

## Getting Started

To run this site locally,

1. Create a file in the project root called `.env.production` with the contents `GATSBY_AIRTABLE_KEY=somekey`. `somekey` needs to be a valid AirTable API key; if you're part of QueerJS and need the real API key, ask another organizer to give it to you.

2. Run the following in terminal: 

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

or 

```sh
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
